In the course of learning to read Chinese characters I've noticed that my ability to recognize characters, even ones I think I know
well, doesn't generalize beyond the straightforward fonts that I am used to seeing (e.g. in learning software or in Android or Windows).
So I have trouble reading product labels, signs, movie posters, etc. This app tries to address this by quizzing me on characters that I
think I know, using a variety of fonts.
